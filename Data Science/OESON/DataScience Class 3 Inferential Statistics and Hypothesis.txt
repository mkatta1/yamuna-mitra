Inferential statistics:
---------------------

conclude or get results we assisting with credibility .
are there resulsts accurate? --> we are inferencing these
hypothesis testing

Partial Sample:
--------------

Surveys sent = 12,000
Surveys completed = 298

Law of Large Numbers:
---------------------

Smaller sample tends to be far away from the mean(population)!
if size increase then sample mean tends to population mean!!

As our sample size grows, its mean tends towards the average of the whold population.

probability of getting a 5 in dice is 1/6 = 16.67%
probability of getting a 2 in dice is 1/6 = 16.67%
Expected Mean = 3.5

Average after 1 roll:
---------------------

Sample Mean (mu) = 2
number of samples (n) = 1

2(1) = 2

Average after 10 rolls:
---------------------

Sample Mean (mu) = 3.1
number of samples (n) = 10

1(3)+ 2(2)+3(1)+4(1)+5(1)+6(2) = 3+4+3+4+5+12 = 31

Hypothesis Test:
---------------

Assumption 1: Our population mean and variance is the same as sample 1 (the 5-year sample)

hypotheses
significance level
statistical test
test and  calculate the p-value
draw a conclusion about the null hypothesis

hypothesis 2 types:
----------------
null hypothesis: states that there is no difference between two parameters.
alternative hypothesis: there is a difference betweent the two parameters.
eg: 7year warranty sold better than 5 year warranty

Our confidence level sets the probability of our test correctly failing to reject the null hypothesis assuming the null hypothesis is true.
confidence level = 95%

common confidence level:
------------------------

alpha = 0.1 for 90%
a1pha = 0.05 for 95%

1-confidencelevel = alpha value
so, if confidence level = 0.95
Alpha value = ? it is 0.05

28 minutes

TWO TAIL T TEST:
----------------
Rejecting and Failing to Reject H0 :
-----------------------------------

confidence level = 95%
Alpha value = 5% = one T is 2.5%, another T is 2.5%

confidence interval 95% of expected samples

one T = 7 year revenue is growing up
another T = 5 year warranty revenue is growing up

Here we are challenging the already proven results.
