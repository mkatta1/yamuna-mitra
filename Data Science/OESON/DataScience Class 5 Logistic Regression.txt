Linear Regression:
Binary classification: 0 & 1

Logistic regression: It is also called as classification algorithm.

It estimates the probability of an event occurring, such as voted or didn't vote, based on a given dataset of independent variables. Since the outcome is a probability, the dependent variable is bounded between 0 and 1. In logistic regression, a logic transformation is applied on the odds-that is, the probability of success divided by the probability of failure.
This is also commonly known as the log odds, or the natural logarithm of odds, and this logistic function is represented by the following formulas:
- logit(pi) = 1/(1+exp(-pi))
ln(pi/(1-pi)) = Beta_0 + Beta_1*x_1 + ...+ B_K*K_k

- In this logistic regression equation, logit(pi) is the dependent or response variable and x is the independent variable. The beta parameter, or coefficient, in this model is commonly estimated via maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). This method tests different values of beta through multiple iterations to optimize for the best fit of log odds. All of these iterations produce the log likelihood function, and logistic regression seeks to maximize this function to find the best parameter estimate. Once the optimal coefficient (or coefficient if there is more than one independent variable) is found, the conditional probabilities for each observation can be calculated, logged, and summed together to yield a predicted probability. For binary classification, a probability less than 0.5 percent 0 while a probability greater than 0 will predict 1.

Hypothesis => Z = WX + B
h(x) = sigmoid()

Sigmoid Function
sig(t) = 1/1+e^-x

3 types of logistic regression models:
1. Binary logistic regression: In this approach, the response or dependent variable is dichotomous in nature -- i.e. it has only two possible outcomes (e.g. 0 or 1). Some popular examples of its use include predicting if an e-mail is spam or not spam or if a tumor is malignant or not malignant. Within logistic regression, this is the most commonly used approach, and more generally, it is one of the most common classifiers for binary classification.

2. Multinomial logistic regression: In this type of logistic regression model, the dependent variable has three or more possible outcomes; however, these values have no specified order. For example, movie studios want to predict what genre of film a moviegoer is likely to see to market films more effectively. A multinomial logistic regression model can help the studio to determine the strength of influence a person's age, gender, and dating status may have on the type of film that they prefer. The studio can then orient an advertising campaign of a specific movie toward a group of people likely to go see it.

3. Ordinal logistic regression: 

This type of logistic regression model is leveraged when the response variable has three or more possible outcome, but in this case, these values do have a defined order. Examples of ordinal responses include grading scales from A to F or 

4. Fraud detection: Logistic regression models can help teams identify data anomalies, which are predictive of fraud. Certain behaviors or characteristics may have a higher association with fraudulent activities, which is particularly helpful to banking and other financial institutions in protecting their clients. SaaS-based companies have also started to adopt these practices to eliminate fake user accounts from their datasets when conducting data analysis around business performance.

5. Disease prediction: In medicine, this analytics approach can be used to predict the likelihood of disease or illness for a given population. Healthcare organizations can set up preventative care for individuals that show higher propensity for specific illnesses.

6. Churn prediction: Specific behaviors may be indicative of churn in different functions of an organization. For example, human resources and management teams may want to know if there are high performers within the company who are at risk of leaving the organization; this type of insight can prompt conversations to understand problem areas within the company, such as culture or compensations to understand problem areas within the company, such as culture or compensation. Alternatively, the sales organization may want to learn which of their clients are at risk of taking their business elsewhere. This can prompt teams to set up a retention strategy to avoid lost revenue.

A bar chart height or length of each bar corresponds to the value being measured, and the bars are usually arranged horizontally or vertically to make comparisons easy.
Comparing data across multiple categories. Showing changes over time.
Displaying survey results. Comparing subcategories. Visualizing budget allocation. Showing ranking.

An area chart is a type of graph that displays quantitative data over time or a continuous interval. It is similar to a line chart, but the area between the line and the x-axis is filled with color or shading. The filled area emphasizes the cumulative magnitude or proportion of the data, making it useful for illustrating trends, comparing multiple datasets, and identifying overall patterns of change.

When to use area chart?
Showing trends over Time
Area charts are effective for displaying trends or changes in data over time. They provide a visual representation of the cumulative values or proportions, making it easy to observe the overall pattern or direction of change.

Comparing multiple data series: Area charts can be used to compare multiple data series or categories. By stacking the filled areas, you can visually compare the relative contributions or proportions of different datasets, enabling insights into the composition or distribution of the data.
Illustrating cumulative data: Area charts are particularly useful for illustrating cumulative data. They showcase the total or cumulative values of multiple variables, allowing for a clear understanding of how the components contribute to the overall sum.

Highlighting patterns and fluctuations:
Area charts help identify patterns, fluctuations, or seasonality in the data. By examining the rise and fall of the filled areas, you can easily spot periods of growth, decline, or cyclical behavior.
 
Communicating Progress or Performance:
Area charts are often used to communicate progress or performance metrics. They provide a visually appealing way to showcase the advancement or achievement of targets, goals, or milestones over time, creating a clear representation of progress.

		WHAT IS BOX PLOT
A box plot, also known as a box-and-whisker plot, is a graphical representation of the distribution of a set of numerical data. It provides a summary of the data's central tendency, spread, and any potential outliers. The plot displays several key statistical measures, including the minimum, maximum, median, and quartiles of the data.
Here are the distribution of a variable and identifies outliers.

MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM: The whiskers or lines extending from the box represent the minimum and maximum values of the data, excluding outliers.
MEDIAN: A line inside the box represents the median, which is the middle value of the dataset when it is ordered. It divides the data into two equal halves.

INTERQUARTILE RANCE (IQR): The box itself represents the IQR, which is the range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3). It contains the middle 50% of the data.
OUTLIERS: Data points that fall outside the whiskers, beyond 1.5 times the IQR from the quartiles, are considered outliers. They are typically represented as individual points or asterisks.

		BUBBLE CHART
A bubble chart is a type of data visualization that represents data points as bubbles or circles on a two dimensional graph. Each bubble's position on the graph corresponds to its x and y values, and the size of the bubble represents a third variable. Bubble charts are useful for displaying and comparing three different data dimensions simultaneously, allowing for the identification of patterns, relationships, and outliers in the data.
