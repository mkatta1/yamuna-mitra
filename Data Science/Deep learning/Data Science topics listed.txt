[coding ninjas] - data science:
==============================

svm - support vector machines is a machine learning algorithm that classifies and analyzes data. SVMs are supervised learning models that use a hyperplane to find the maximum distance between classes in a data set. This distance is called the margin, and SVMs are designed to maximize the margin while minimizing classification errors.

NLP can refer to either Natural Language Processing or Neuro-Linguistic Programming: 

A machine learning technology that allows computers to understand, manipulate, and generate human language. NLP is used in many applications, including: 

Neural networks, Tensor flow, Keras, LSTM, PCA, Unsupervised learning
