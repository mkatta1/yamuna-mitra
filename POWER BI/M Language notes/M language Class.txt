M language is for performing tranformations using shortcuts. Instead of adding multiple steps to the PowerQuery, we can edit the columns.

Suppose we want to change the columnName/expression/fileFormat so on... inside an language we can do that.

If we don't want to start from scratch, we can duplicate&rename the source 
that we want to and 

Single User can use Power Bi Desktop to create reports which can be published to PowerBiService.

After creation we have Favorites, Recent, + Create, Datasets,Goals, Apps, Shared with me, Workspaces to manage & create, and myWorkspace.

In myWorkspace is our own personal workspace we can also publish reports of our own but not shared. It contains Dashboard(part of reports), Reports, Workbooks (Excel workbooks), and Datasets.

Now click on "publish" in our Bi Desktop --> Sigin with the account email address --> Choose MyWorkspace or any other workspace create!!

We can also create any other workspace we want which would not be personal one!
Lineage can be seen for reports if we click on VIEW --> LINEAGE instead of LIST. This will show the sources, reports and their hierarchies.

DATAGateway usage: If there are any changes in the datasets then Reports can be refreshed but if there are any changes to be reflected on the datasets then we need a DATAGateway.
