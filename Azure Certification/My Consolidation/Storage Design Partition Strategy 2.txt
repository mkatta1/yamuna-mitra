DELTA TABLE BEST PRACTICES AND THEIR CODE TO DO IT:

It contains z ordering, optimize to compact the files. Don't delete files from the directory level, instead overwrite them.

DESIGNING PARTITIONS:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/data-partitioning#designing-partitions-for-query-performance

Horizontal partitioning (often called sharding): Each partition is known as a shard. For example: Each shard holds the data for a contiguous range of shard keys (A-G and H-Z), organized alphabetically. Try to minimize HOT partitions means data starts with similar letters.
Vertical partitioning: each partition holds a subset of the fields/columns which are used mostly in the data store
Functional partitioning: data is aggregated according to how it is used by each bounded context in the system.For example, an e-commerce system might store invoice data in one partition and product inventory data in another. Separate read, write data to read only data.

Temporal table implementation is seen in SSMS: SQL SERVER MANAGEMENT STUDIO, SSDT SQL SERVER DATA TOOL, AZURE DATA STUDIO or any other T-SQL
SYSTEM_VERSION TABLE -->TEMPORAL TABLE

WITH T-SQL, temporal table creation
CREATE TABLE TABLE_NAME (COLUMNS) WITH (SYSTEM_VERSIONING = ON (HISTORY_TABLE = dbo.HISTORY_TABLE_NAME)


Temporal tables old versions are stored as history tables. It is a system-versioned temporal table.
Simply SCD-TYPE2 mechanism is seen and the validto, validfrom uses the datetime2 data type

Incrementally copy a table using the below:
Normally, the data in this selected column (for example, last_modify_time or ID) keeps increasing when rows are created or updated. The maximum value in this column is used as a WATERMARK.
