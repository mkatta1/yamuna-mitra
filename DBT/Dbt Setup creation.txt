CREATE YOUR DBT FOLDER MANUALLY (DO THIS OTHERWISE DBT WILL FAIL TO CREATE A NEW PROJECT)

Windows:

Make sure to execute mkdir %userprofile%\.dbt in a cmd window to ensure you can create a dbt project (you are instructed to do this in the dbt setup lecture).

WSL Windows users:

If you prefer using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) instead of a native installation, you can find WSL-based instructions in the last section of the course, Supplementary Materials.

If you already have Python, pip, and virtualenv installed, feel free to create a folder for the course (I'm using Desktop/course), create a virtualenv called venv and skip the following two videos about Python setup and Virtualenv.
