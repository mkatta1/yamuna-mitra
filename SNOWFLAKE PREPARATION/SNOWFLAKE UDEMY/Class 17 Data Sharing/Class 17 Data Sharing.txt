- Usually this can be also a rather complicated process
- Data sharing without actual copy of the data & uptodate
- Shared data can be consumed by the own compute resources
- Non-snowflake-Users can also access through a reader account


Server1, Server2, Server3	 Read only Server2 (Account 2 : Consumer)
\_______________________/======>
Account 1 : Producer


Two methods of creating a data share:

1) SQL commands:

- Create a stage, table, database, schema etc...
- Create a share object and grant priveleges to the above objects!!!
- SHOW GRANTS TO SHARE [shareName]; --> to know priveleges and its types to share object
- Add consumer account to the share. So that he will also get the privileges that are needed as well
Eg: ALTER SHARE ORDERS_SHARE ADD ACCOUNT = kaa74702;-->account Id number!!

 


2) Using UI

1) First click on the top right corner profile -> Switch Role -> Choose "Account Admin"
2) Top pane click on shares ->  Inbound & Outbound shares
3) click on "Add Consumers"-> choose "reader" or "Full" . For non snowflake user we use "Reader" but for others we use "Full"
4) Create, Edit & Drop Shares 
5) Create share -> give sharename, dbName, SchemaName, tableName or viewName
Outbound contain our created shares!!
Inbound contain others created shares!!


Sharing with Non Snowflake users , 
New reader account -> Independant instance with own url & own compute resources, 
share data -> share database & tables, 
create uses -> As administrator create user & roles
create database -> In reader account create database from share

Notes to follow:
1) Using+data+sharing
2) Create+reader+account
3) Sharing database and schema -> share+entire+db+or+schema
4) Sharing+views
5) Secure+views
