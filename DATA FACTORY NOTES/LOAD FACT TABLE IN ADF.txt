Flow1:

Blob1 -> Lookup1 -> SELECT ->

Source2:

Dim


From Flow1:

In Blob1 contains the fact data
In Lookup1 contains the Blob1(left) JOIN Dim(Rift) and conditions are:
EmpID==EmpId
SalesDate>=FromDate
SalesDate<=ToDate

Note:
You need to mention which table you want to have in broadcast.
By default, it is auto but while debugging the pipeline asks us to select the dataset.
We can select both fact and Dim but it is better to select Dim.
BROADCAST AS "FIXED" instead of AUTO
So, we will select Dimension as the broadcast table

In Select transformation, we use select only SCDKEY from Dimension table and the rest are neglected.
