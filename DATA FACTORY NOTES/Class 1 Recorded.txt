Cost effective: ADF is serverless, and the billing is based on factors such as the number of activities.
If you run a pipline hourly, which also involves data movement (assuming 100GB data movement per hourly run, which should take around 8 minutes with 200MBps bandwidth), then ADF would bill you not more than $12 for the monthly execution.

90+ connectors 

- Companies policies can restrict to securly on high level on subscriptions 
- Managementgroups > Subscriptions > Resource Groups > Resources

Support+troubleshooting -> how to create support ticket etc

ADF ---> Activity log to check last 45 days logs like subscription, resourcegroup,Resource 

ADF --> Access control --> initiall you will get "Contributor" role

Day 6
ADF settings->Networking -> Private endpoint connections

Without using credentials, we can "System assigned Managed identities" are used which are tied to life cycle of that particular resource (like ADF, Storage, ...) . Restricted one per resource.

{connectionstrings, username,passwords, sas keys, certificates, appsecrets, client secret, connection strings} --> Managed Identity

access policies are req to use keyvalut which is again a process. So better to use Managed Identity!!

	-- Instead of Managed Identity the service principal process ---

Create service principal -> Grant permissions -> Set credentials -> Store credentials on resource -> Rotate credentials -> Clean up credentials -> Delete service principal

Create Azure resource(ADF) with managed identity
