It is also useful to understand SQL CAST & CONVERT functions. We discussed DATE, CAST & CONVERT functions in Parts 25 to 28 in our SQL Server Tutorial.

After watching this video you should be able to answer any sql date interview questions similar to the following.

Write a SQL query to get

1. All people who are born on a given date (For example, 9th October 2017)

2. All people who are born between 2 given dates (For example, all people born between Nov 1, 2017 and Dec 31, 2017)

3. All people who are born on the same day and month excluding the year (For example, 9th October)

4. All people who are born yesterday, today, tomorrow, last seven days, and next 7 days

5. All people whose birth year is the same (For example, all people born in 2017, 2018 etc.)

Once you are comfortable answering these questions you can extend the concepts you have learned to answer similar questions like the following. 

1. Orders placed between 2 given dates or on a given day, month, year etc.

2. Customers gained or lost.

3. Employees joined or left etc.
